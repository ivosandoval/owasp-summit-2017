## Why

The Spotify Model has been widely adopted by multiple companies, but to integrate Agile Security Practices into it.

We need companies that have tried, failed and succeeded to integrate security into an Spotify Model to share their experiences

The Spotify model of Squads, Tribes and Guilds (using multiple Agile methodogies) presents the oportunity to define global practices and
activities that can be replicated across multiple teams (and geographical locations and cultures)

## What

- CISO's
