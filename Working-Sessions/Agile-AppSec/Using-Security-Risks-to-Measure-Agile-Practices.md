## Why

A key problem of Agile practices in large organizations is 'how to measure them?'.

If you have 10 squads/teams across multiple buildings/countries, how to measure their 'level of agility'?

This Working Session will expore the use of Security Risks an way to measure and visualise those practices (the core idea
 is that the less Agile an team is, the more risks it will have and the harder it will be to make code changes/deployments)

## What

 - Defining the Risk metrics to look for (code deployments, patching issues, 'time to fix vulns' ratios, re-occurence of bugs/vulnerabilities, missed deadlines, etc...)
 - Creating dashboards to visualise the data collected
 - What other metrics can be used to measure Agile Practices (outside risk)
 - How is this currently being tracked?

## Who

The target audience for this Working Session is:

- Security professionals
- CISO's
- Agile practitioners
